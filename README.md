# TIPP-PSA_Neural-Network
TIPP - Student Project M2-PSA Strasbourg - "Make your own neural network with numpy"

Students: Sacha Cormenier and Corentin Roumegou

Tutor: Giulio Dujany

The goal of the project is to code a simple supervised neural network using numpy in python 3. This Neural Network will then be tested with data from the Belle II experiment.
