Here are the data from Belle2 used to test our neural networks scripts

The original file "dataset.csv" is too big for GitHub.
data100.csv contains the 100 first lines of the data. It is used for training.
data100_2.csv contains the next 100 lines of the data. It is used for testing.
It is the same for data500 and data500_2 except they contains 500 lines each.
The files "-Normalized" contains as much 'signal events' as 'background events'.
